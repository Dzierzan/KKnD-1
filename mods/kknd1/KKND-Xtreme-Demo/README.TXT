KKND Xtreme Demo Quick Reference Guide
--------------------------------------

DIRECTX 5
---------
KKND Xtreme requires DirectX 5.  If you do not have DirectX 5 installed on your machine, you will have to install it before playing this demo.  You can download DirectX 5 from:
http://www.microsoft.com/directx/resources/downloads/dx5eng.exe
ftp://ftp.avault.com/drivers/dx5eng.exe


THE MISSIONS
------------
You get four KKND Xtreme missions in this demo, two each for the freaky Evolved and the militant Survivors.  The first mission for each team is designed to bring you up to speed on the game while the second missions are for Xtreme players!  New KKND Xtreme players might want to play the Evolved mission "Walkover" first.  Or you might want to play the intro screen for a few hours instead, and who are we to stop you?


THE OBJECT
----------
You set up your forces, find and drill for oil, process it to get more resource units, then spend the resource units to create more forces.  Keep this up until you either complete the one-player mission objectives or destroy the other armies in multiplayer gaming.


OIL & WHAT TO DO WITH IT
------------------------
  (Note that you could do some of the following simultaneously to save time)
  Send out units to expose areas of the map.  When you've uncovered a black, bubbling puddle, you've struck oil. 
  Select a Mobile Derrick, then send it to the oil tap-in point (the cursor will change to a drilling cursor while over the oil).  When the Derrick arrives, it unfolds into an Oil Rig and starts pumping oil.
  Build a Power Station.  A bonus Oil Tanker will pop out of the completed Power Station.  It'll start shuttling between Rig and Power Station, transporting oil to be converted into Resource Units.
  Note: Oil seams dry up.  Clicking on an Oil Rig will give a display of how much oil remains in the seam.  When oil runs out, you'll have to build another mobile oil derrick (if possible) and send it out to find a new tap in point.


HOW TO INCREASE A BUILDING'S TECH LEVEL
---------------------------------------
  Increasing the Tech Level of a building allows it to create more complex units.  
  Build a Research Lab (Survivor) or Alchemy Hall (Evolved).  
  Left click on the Research Lab/Alchemy Hall.  The cursor changes to the Research cursor. 
  Move the Research cursor over the desired building and left click to begin research.  
  When the icon pulses at full colour, research will be complete and the Tech Level will increase by one.

INTERFACE
---------
SELECTING
  Left click on a unit to select it.  Left click and drag a selection box around a group of units to select them all.

DESELECTING
  Right click to deselect a unit or group.

PRESETTING & RECALLING GROUPS
  Select a unit or group, then hold CTRL and press a number between 1 and 10 (0).  To quickly select that unit or group in future, simply press the number to which it was assigned.

ORDERING TO MOVE
  After selecting a unit or group, click on the map where you want them to go.  You can order them anywhere onto valid land or into the black, unexposed map.  You'll be shown a No Go cursor for areas of exposed map where units cannot go (holes in the ground, etc).

ORDERING TO ATTACK
  After selecting a unit or group of units, click on an enemy unit or building.  Your team will move within attacking range and start causing damage.

DEPLOYING UNITS
  The Mobile Outpost (S), Mobile Clan Hall (E) and Mobile Derrick (S&E) need to be 'unpacked' to operate.  To deploy the first two, send the unit to a clear area.  If it's a suitable spot and you move the cursor over the unit, you will get a 'deploy' cursor.  Left click on the unit to construct it.  For the Mobile Derricks, see under OIL AND WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

MAKING BUILDINGS/GUARD TOWERS
  To make buildings or guard towers, left click and hold on the desired icon, then drag it onto the map.  The cursor will become a full-sized, ghostly image of the building.  Place it on a valid spot and left click.  The building will form in stages, and you'll be informed when it's finished.  If the ghostly 'build' image is totally red, it means you are trying to build it too far away from other buildings.  If the image is partially red, it means something under that square is preventing a build.  If units/vehicles are the culprits, right click to cancel building, move the offending units out of the way, and commence building again.  If a land feature (eg. hole, clump of trees) is preventing building, then you'll have to build somewhere else.

MAKING INFANTRY/VEHICLES/ANIMALS
  To make these units, you'll need either and Outpost (Survivor)/Clan Hall (Evolved) for people, a Machine Shop(S)/Blacksmith(E) for vehicles and a Beast Enclosure (E) for animals.  To build the units, click the relevant icon on the control panel and a fly-out menu will appear of all available units.  Left clicking on one of these begins building (a 'build' bar appears on the button, indicating the progress of the build).  Multiple left clicking on a button queues a number of units, up to 9 at a time, and the number of queued units is also displayed on the button.  To cancel creation, right click on the same button (you might need to do this multiple times if you've queued multiple units).

REPAIRING BUILDINGS
  To repair buildings, you first need to build a Technician (Survivor) or Mekanik (Evolved).  Send one of these people into a damaged building and it'll start the healing process.

REPAIRING VEHICLES/ANIMALS   *** Only available in full game! ***
   To repair vehicles/animals, build a Repair Bay (S) or Menagerie (E).  Select the damaged unit, then left click on the Repair Bay/Menagerie to send it there.

INFILTRATION & DEFENSE   *** Only available in full game! ***
   Each building contains a number of defenders, as represented on the building's status bar by red parralelograms.  Saboteurs (S) and Vandals (E) have two roles in dealing with buildings.  If they enter an enemy building, they neutralise one defender.  If the number of defenders is reduced to zero, and then one more Saboteur/Vandal is sent in to do the dirty work, the building will explode and the value of the building will be added to the destroyers resource units.  Note that sending Saboteurs/Vandals into their own side's buildings turns them into defenders, and the defender count goes up by one.

VETERAN UNITS
   A normal unit's health bar has a grey border.  When a unit has engaged in enough combat, it becomes a veteran unit.  The two stages of veteran units are distinguishable from normal plebbs by their blue and red health bar borders respectively.  Veteran units are more accurate and have a higher fire rate.  Human veterans (of both sides) can also heal themselves, regaining lost hit points, if they stay still.


KAOS MODE   *** Only available in the full version of KKND Xtreme ***
---------
Kaos mode allows you to play a single player game on one of the fifteen multiplayer maps in KKND Xtreme.  In a KAos game you can choose to have from 1 to 3 enemy teams on the map and from 0 to 2 allied teams fighting with you.


MULTIPLAYER GAMING   *** Only Available in the full version of KKND Xtreme ***
------------------
ACCESSING MULTIPLAYER GAMES
   Click 'Multiplayer Game' from the main menu.  You'll then have to choose between IPX (for an IPX network game of 2-6 players), Modem (2 players over a phone line) or Serial (2 players over a serial cable).

IPX : NETWORK GAMING
   This screen lists all the games currently active on the network.  You have two choices here: Join Game and New Game.  Join Game is only active if you click on a game you  wish to join.  If you do so, you'll be taken to the 'Client Screen'.  Clicking 'New' tags you as the 'Server'.  You'll have more to configure, and this is all listed under the 'Server Screen' below.

MODEM GAME
   You select from here whether you'll call someone to play or await their call.  You can edit the information to make future connections simpler.  NEW FRIEND: Takes you to the New Friend Entry screen, where you enter your friend's name (press Enter when you're done), cycle through your friend's Modem Baud Rate and enter their phone number.  Press 'Add This Friend' when you're done.  EDIT FRIEND:  Edits the Friend information.  DELETE FRIEND:  Removes a friend from the list.  DIAL: If you are to be the Server, click this when you've finalised everything and wait for your friend to connect.  When this happens, you'll end up at the Server screen (see below).  WAIT FOR CALL:  If you're to be a client, not the server, click this to let the Server know you're ready to connect.  You'll be taken to the Client screen (see below).

SERIAL GAME
   Only 2 choices here.  If you are to be the Server, click 'Connect' and wait for your buddy.  If you're to be Client, click 'Wait for Connection'.  When you're both in, you'll go to your relevant screens (see below).

THE CLIENT SCREEN
   As a client (ie. not the server), you have a few options.  Enter your name in the 'Name' box and press Enter when you're done.  Click the 'Side' button to choose the 'race' of the army you want to control.  Then choose 'Colour' to pick what colour you want your army to wear.  Then just wait for the Server to start the game.

THE SERVER SCREEN
   The Name, Side and Colour options are the same as for Client setup (above).  The Server has some extra options too.   STARTING RU'S: Select how many Resource Units everyone will have when they begin (from 1000 to 50000).  MAX. TECH LEVEL:  Choose from 1 to 5 to decide how high everyone will be permitted to advance.  TECH BUNKERS: If set to 'on', then Tech Bunkers, containing strange, old-world technology, will be accessible to whoever finds them first.  SELECT MAP:  Choose a map to play on which you want to play.

START GAME
   When everyone is locked in, the Server clicks on 'Start Game'.  Everyone then must set up their forces and try to destroy all enemy units to win the game.

ALLIANCES
   Available to Network players is the ability to ally your army with others.  To form an alliance, place your cursor over the soon-not-to-be enemy and press the 'A' key.  Allied armies will not attack allied units or buildings, unless you order them to do so.  As soon as they fire upon allied units, the alliance is broken.
